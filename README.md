Related Tech :Python,Gradio,Python Web Development

Currently Developing a Python-based interactive math quiz application using Streamlit. The aim of the application is to dynamically 
generate mathematical problems  and include a timer that transitions questions every few seconds. 
At the end of the quiz, users can view all questions and their correct answers in a structured format.

**Version1**-the mathematical Problems (expressions, squares, and cubes) with time limit of 5 seconds each.
its giving the questions at a stretch and timer works for all the questions at once.
**example**-no of question to be generated=3,then 3 questions are generated with time limit of 15 seconds as a total.

**idea for next version:**
i want the app to generate a question and timer starts and after the time limit automatically more to 
next question.
